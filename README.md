basic chart package Uncharted and adapts Uncharted charts for display as components in LiveView.

***Charts Included***:
- The Bar Chart
- The Column Chart
- The Donut Chart
- The Line Chart
- The Pie Chart
- The Progress Chart
- The Scatter Plot

### Example Application
The [Uncharted Demo](https://github.com/unchartedelixir/demo) is a working example of each of the Uncharted chart components.

To start the demo Phoenix server:

* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
* Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the assets directory
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.
